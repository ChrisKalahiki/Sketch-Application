# Sketch-Application
A simple sketch application in Java

This was designed in a freshman programming class at Louisiana Tech University.
The goal was to demonstrate understanding of the Java programming language by demonstrating
object-oriented programming as well as being able to create a GUI. Now that the class has ended, 
I am making the code public. It may be a helpful resource to newer programmers.
